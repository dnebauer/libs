NAME

    Dn::Cards - a library to aid in using images for game card production

SYNOPSIS

        use Dn::Cards;
        ...

DESCRIPTION

    A collection of modules and scripts used to aid in processing images
    for use in making game cards. The library was designed with a specific
    use case in mind: preparing image files for upload to Printer's Studio
    <http://www.printerstudio.com/unique-ideas/blank-playing-cards.html>
    for manufacturing custom game cards.

    This library contains the following primary modules: Dn::Cards,
    Dn::Cards::ExtractPdfPages, Dn::Cards::Resize,
    Dn::Cards::UniquefyImages and Dn::Cards::ExtractImages. Three of these
    modules have submodules.

    This library contains the following scripts: dn-cards-images-extract,
    dn-cards-pdf-extract, dn-cards-resize and dn-cards-uniquefy.

    See individual man pages for further details.

    Although this library was designed with a specific use case in mind,
    the scripts and, in particular, the modules, were designed to have as
    wide an application as possible.
