Description: Customised Curses::Widgets::ListBox widget
 The original ListBox widget provided by Curses::Widgets checks
 the input key for whether it is an exit key before processing
 it.  For this reason it is not possible to use one key to both
 select an option and exit the menu, which is the default
 behaviour most users expect.
 .
 This customised version of the widget overrides the 'execute'
 method from Curses::Widgets to process the input key before
 checking whether it is an exit key.  Because of this, if the
 same key is used for TOGGLE and FOCUSSWITCH it will
 simultaneously select the current menu item and exit.
