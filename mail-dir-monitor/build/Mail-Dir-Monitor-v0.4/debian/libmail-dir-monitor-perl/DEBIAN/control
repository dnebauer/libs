Description: daemon to monitor mail queue directories
 Users whose email client handles all aspects of email management from
 checking for, downloading, reading, composing and sending email messages do
 not need this daemon. They should stop reading now and move on.
 .
 Some users, for inexplicable reasons, use different utilities to manage
 different email tasks. For example, offlineimap to download mail, notmuch to
 index, thread and search mail, mutt (terminal) or astroid (gui) to read and
 compose mail, and msmtp to send mail. In these configurations mail for
 sending is often written to a directory where these messages are queued
 before being sent. When the user's internet connection is interrupted these
 messages cannot be sent and, depending on the configuration and fuctionality
 of the email-related programs, such messages may become stranded and not sent
 even when internet connectivity is restored. This daemon is designed to be
 useful in this very specific situation.
