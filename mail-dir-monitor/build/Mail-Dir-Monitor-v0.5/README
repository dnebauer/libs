NAME

    Mail::Dir::Monitor - daemon to monitor mail queue directories

VERSION

    This documentation applies to Mail::Dir::Monitor version 0.5.

SYNOPSIS

        my $monitor = Mail::Dir::Monitor->new;
        $monitor->run;

DESCRIPTION

    Users whose email client handles all aspects of email management from
    checking for, downloading, reading, composing and sending email
    messages do not need this daemon. They should stop reading now and move
    on.

    Some users, for inexplicable reasons, use different utilities to manage
    different email tasks. For example, offlineimap to download mail,
    notmuch to index, thread and search mail, mutt (terminal) or astroid
    (gui) to read and compose mail, and msmtp to send mail. In these
    configurations mail for sending is often written to a directory where
    these messages are queued before being sent. When the user's internet
    connection is interrupted these messages cannot be sent and, depending
    on the configuration and fuctionality of the email-related programs,
    such messages may become stranded and not sent even when internet
    connectivity is restored. This daemon is designed to be useful in this
    very specific situation.

    This is meant to be run as a daemon to monitor mail queue directories
    for "stuck" mail which remains unsent. If any files are found on two
    consecutive scans, the details are written to the system log. The user
    who owns the mail queue may optionally be notified by local user mail
    and by a message sent to their active terminal with the write utility.
    Whether these notifications are sent depends on how the mail queue
    directories are configured (see "CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT" for
    further details). Log messages are also written during startup when
    configuration files are read (also discussed in "CONFIGURATION AND
    ENVIRONMENT").

 Logging

    Module Logger::Syslog is used for logging. Note that not all message
    levels appear in all system logs. On debian, for example, log file
    /var/log/messages records only info and warning messages while
    /var/log/syslog records messages of all levels.

    This module generates only info and warning level messages.

 Daemonising this module

    While this module is intended to be run as a daemon, no daemonising
    scripts are packaged with it. One set of such scripts,
    mail-dir-launcher and mail-dir-monitor, are packaged together with the
    files needed to run it as a systemd service. On debian system it may be
    packaged as mail-dir-monitor and available from the same sources as
    this module.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

 Properties

    None.

 Configuration

    There is a system-wide configuration directory. Running this module
    with the --conf_dir option set to true will print the configuration
    directory path for your system to the console. The directory path is
    most likely SYSCONF_DIR/mail-dir-monitor.d (/etc/mail-dir-monitor.d on
    debian systems), but the definitive value is obtained by using the
    --conf_dir option. All files in the configuration directory are read at
    startup.

    Each configuration file should use ini format and define a single mail
    queue directory. It does so by defining three required values (dir,
    name and user) and three optional values (mail, mask and write),
    explained further below. For options requiring boolean values use 1 and
    0 for true and false, respectively; other values will cause the module
    to die on startup.

    dir

      The path to the directory.

      String. Required.

    mail

      Whether to notify user of blocked email messages by sending an email
      to their local user account using the mail utility that is standard
      on *nix systems. Will have no effect if no mail executable is
      available.

      Note that most systems are not set up by default to notify a user
      when local user mail is received -- local user mail is handled
      differently to email received from an ISP. The only notification is
      that users receive a message in their terminal the next time they log
      into it. Users who rely on a graphical user interface and do not use
      terminals will never see any notifications regarding local user mail.

      Boolean. Optional. Default: false.

    mask

      By default this module monitors all files in a mail queue directory.
      Sometimes, however, it may be preferable to monitor only a particular
      type of file. For example, in mail configurations including msmtp
      each email sent can result in two files being created in the mail
      queue directory: a .msmtp file and a .mail file. Since notification
      messages include a list of "stuck" files, to minimise message size it
      may be desirable to monitor only one of those two file types.

      This is done by specifying a regular expression that matches the file
      type to be monitored. Only the expression itself need by specified.
      For example, to specify .msmtp files you may use the value
      "[.]msmtp\Z". This will be converted internally into the regular
      expression

          qr/[.]msmtp\Z/xsm

      String. Optional. Default: ".*".

    name

      A human readable name for the directory intended to be used in user
      feedback. The name can consist of multiple words. It should fit
      naturally into the following sentence instead of NAME: "The NAME has
      stuck email files."

      String. Required.

    user

      User login name of the owner of the mail queue. This is used for
      sending direct feedback via local mail and terminal messages, so if
      there is any confusion over the ownership of a mail queue, choose the
      user to whom notifications should be sent. This value is required
      even if both mail and write are to be left disabled.

      Boolean. Optional. Default: false.

    write

      Whether to notify user of blocked email messages by sending a message
      directly to their terminal using the write utility that is standard
      on *nix systems. Will have no effect if no write executable is
      available.

      Individual users can configure their terminals to not receive write
      messages, though on most system the default for users is to allow
      display of such messages. See the manpage for write for more details.

      There are a number of circumstances in which it may be inadvisable to
      utilise this method of notification:

	* Users who rely on a graphical user environment and do not use
	terminals.

	* Users who primarily use terminals for console editors, such as
	vim, as the messages sent by write will disrupt the editor display.

	* Users who routinely use multiple terminals and/or terminal
	multiplexers, as the message will be sent to only one terminal and
	that terminal may not be visible to the user at the time the
	message is sent.

      Boolean. Optional. Default: false.

 Environment

    This module does not use environment variables.

OPTIONS

    conf_dir

      Display path to configuration directory and exit.

      Flag. Optional. Default: false.

    delay

      Delay in seconds between checking mail queue directories. Do not make
      this too short or false errors may be generated by large emails which
      take a significant amount of time to send.

      Scalar integer. Optional. Default: 300 (5 minutes).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 run()

    This is the only public method. It starts a daemon which periodically
    checks mail directories for "stuck" email, as described in
    "DESCRIPTION".

DIAGNOSTICS

    An invalid key was found in a configuration file. Warning.

  No files in configuration directory

    The configuration directory (SYSCONF_DIR/mail-dir-monitor.d>) contains

  No mail queue directories discovered, exiting

    No mail queue directories were defined by processing all configuration
    files. Fatal.
